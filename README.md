# 👋 Hello there, I'm Andy Polhill. I'm an _Engineering Manager._

I have a background in Software Engineering working at senior levels in different disciplines and industries. Over the years my focus has shifted and I find new satisfaction in leading teams and helping individuals to achieve their goals.

I like to keep technical and you'll see me tinkering on [Github](http://github.com/andy-polhill). I particularly like work that enables teams to move faster and more effectively. If you need to get hold of me, I'm on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/andy_polhill) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andy-polhill/).
