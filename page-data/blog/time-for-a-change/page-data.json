I was in no desperate rush to leave my current role, but I was adamant it was the route I wanted to take. I put a lot of focus into the companies that I would like to work for, companies with a mission or a product I could get behind.

I could write a whole blog post on this alone, but I've found that staying relevant does help. I practised a few coding challenges just to make sure my brain could still operate in that space.

One key difference between recruitment pipelines was that some companies were recruiting for a specific role, whilst others would direct you to a role based on your skills. I applied for one where there was a good values fit but my technical background just didn't match the technology, this was certainly a more mutual rejection.\"), mdx(\"p\", null, \"Throughout the process my only real horror story was a company who attempted to replicate an in person day at the office over video calls. The process consisted of 4 hours of back to back video calls, seamless transitions from one call to another with no opportunity for a break. By the end of it I have no idea what I confessed too.

Your journey will be different. Maybe you'll get the first job you apply for. Maybe it will take longer, you might have to take some breaks to fill those skills gaps once you know where they are. Just remember there isn't a right or wrong, just persist, be resilient, accept that there may be tough times, but you will get there.
